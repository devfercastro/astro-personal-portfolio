  "about": [
    "I began coding in 2019, building small websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for fun. Soon after, I explored backend development with Node.js, then frontend with React. Things really clicked when I watched YouTube tutorials that demonstrated the complexity of real-world projects.",
    "I later joined FreeCodeCamp, where I deepened my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and programming while improving my English. During college, I also landed my first developer role at Battlerol, working on a web RPG game called Meeple Combat, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.",
    "Tackling challenging coding problems sparked my interest in algorithms, leading me to LeetCode and a focus on data structures. Now, I'm building my own projects with Next.js and Astro, and contributing to the open-source community."
