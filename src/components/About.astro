		<p>My coding journey began in 2019, building small websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for fun. Soon after, I explored backend development with Node.js, followed by frontend work with React. Things clicked when I dove into YouTube tutorials, showing me the complexity of real-world projects.</p>
		<p>I later joined FreeCodeCamp, where I deepened my knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and programming while improving my English skills. In college, I landed my first developer role at Battlerol, working on a web RPG game called Meeple Combat, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
		<p>Challenging coding problems sparked my interest in algorithms, leading me to LeetCode and a deeper focus on data structures. Now, I'm building my own projects with Next.js and Astro, while actively contributing to the open-source community.</p>
